def word_count():
    # For this exercise, write a program that serially counts the number of occurrences
    # of each word in the book Alice in Wonderland.
    #
    # The text of Alice in Wonderland will be fed into your program line-by-line.
    # Your program needs to take each line and do the following:
    # 1) Tokenize the line into string tokens by whitespace
    #    Example: "Hello, World!" should be converted into "Hello," and "World!"
    #    (This part has been done for you.)
    #
    # 2) Remove all punctuation
    #    Example: "Hello," and "World!" should be converted into "Hello" and "World"
    #
    # 3) Make all letters lowercase
    #    Example: "Hello" and "World" should be converted to "hello" and "world"
    #
    # Store the the number of times that a word appears in Alice in Wonderland
    # in the word_counts dictionary, and then *print* (don't return) that dictionary
    #
    # In this exercise, print statements will be considered your final output. Because
    # of this, printing a debug statement will cause the grader to break. Instead, 
    # you can use the logging module which we've configured for you.
    #
    # For example:
    # logging.info("My debugging message")
    #
    # The logging module can be used to give you more control over your
    # debugging or other messages than you can get by printing them. Messages 
    # logged via the logger we configured will be saved to a
    # file. If you click "Test Run", then you will see the contents of that file
    # once your program has finished running.
    # 
    # The logging module also has other capabilities; see 
    # https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html
    # for more information.
